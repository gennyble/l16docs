A user on GitHub, helloavo, has archived quite a bit of software and information
to do with the L16. They have also managed to get ahold of the latest firmware!
You can download it from their Light-L16-Archive repository under the
[releases section](https://github.com/helloavo/Light-L16-Archive/releases/tag/1.3.5.1).
Download the file `LFC-1351-0-00WW-A01-update.zip` and follow the below steps.

**NOTE:** if you rooted your L16 prior to updating this, be sure to remove it
as going through these steps may soft brick your device. You will have to
recover from backups if this occurs.

Try to have at least half of a charge before upgrading the firmware.

1. Connect your camera to your computer
2. Unlock your camera, swipe the notification pane down, and select "File Transfers (MTP)".
3. Copy the firmware, still in the zip file, to the root directory of the L16; to the L16's internal storage.
4. Unplug the camera and power it off.
5. Turn the camera on. You should have a notification to apply the update.
6. Agree to the terms and choose install. **The L16 will restart multiple times during this process**.
7. After this is finished, the camera should be updated to 1.3.5.1. You should check this in the settings.
